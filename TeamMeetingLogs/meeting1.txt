Vision Statement: A site where artists are immersed in their communities, can share and interact with the local arts and artists.

Application Description: 
Short: We're developing an art gallery website where users may log in, customize their profiles, and browse available artwork. Users will have the ability to click on individual artworks to view detailed descriptions, titles, and any supplementary information. Additionally, users may choose to search for events to include local art shows.


Long:
Our team project revolves around creating an art gallery website, akin to Pinterest but with a focus on art pieces and collections. Users will have the ability to register accounts and subsequently log in, unlocking a plethora of features tailored to both artists and art enthusiasts alike.
Key functionalities include:

Browsing Art: Users can explore a diverse array of artworks and delve deeper into each piece with comprehensive descriptions.
Event Discovery: Find art-related events with ease. Users can even search for events in their vicinity.
Following Collections and Artists: Stay updated on favorite collections or artists by following them.
Personal Collections: Users can curate their own collections of art, tailoring their browsing experience to their preferences.
Profile Customization: Personalize user profiles to reflect individual tastes and interests.

To achieve this, we'll develop several pages using Handlebars, dynamically populating them with user data and information using JavaScript. User data, including usernames and passwords, will be stored using SQL databases, ensuring security and accessibility. Furthermore, we'll integrate various APIs, such as Ticketmaster for event information and art gallery APIs for accessing artworks, including images and descriptions, enriching the user experience.

Ultimately, our project aims to cater to both artists and art enthusiasts, offering a platform where they can explore, engage, and appreciate art in its myriad forms.
